    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This last week I spent 3 days in Banff, Canada to speak at the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nmc2010.org/"&gt;7th International Workshop on Nanomechanical Cantilever Sensors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;. I flew into Calgary Tuesday night and drove nearly 2 hours to Banff, arriving after midnight. This was my first visit to the area, which is stunningly beautiful. The town is set in a valley in the Rocky Mountains surrounded by tall, steep mountains covered with forest. Unfortunately, the weather was wet, cold, and cloudy so I wasn&#x2019;t able to get a clear view most of the time. Thursday morning I got up early and did a 5 mile run in the rain. The next morning I did a 7-8 mile run except it was actually snowing. Pretty strange running in the snow at the end of May!&#xD;&#xD;Some pictures from the trip are at the link below.&#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.me.com/greg.nordin/Utah_Offroad_Biking/My_Albums/Pages/Photos-Banff_2010.html#0"&gt;2010 Banff Photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
