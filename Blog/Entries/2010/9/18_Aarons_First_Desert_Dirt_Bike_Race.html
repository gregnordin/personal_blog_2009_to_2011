                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">This was my son Aaron’s (age 23) first desert race. We drove up to Snowville in northern Utah just below the Idaho border and arrived at pit row about 9:15 am. During the first hour of the drive I told Aaron about all of the lessons I’ve learned from my races, and covered what to expect at different stages of the race. However, no amount of talking can adequately prepare someone for the actual experience of doing a race.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Here is a link to a Google map that has my gps track of the race course (one loop is 30 miles and the race consisted of two loops for a total of 60 miles): <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="http://nanomicro.byu.edu/~nordin/Maps/2010-09-18 RACE-Snowville with Aaron.html" href="http://nanomicro.byu.edu/~nordin/Maps/2010-09-18%20RACE-Snowville%20with%20Aaron.html" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">Google map</a>. The start was at the little spur on the left-most part of the track and we ran it clockwise.<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style">It took 3 hrs 30 min to complete the race with the second loop being faster than the first because there weren’t as many people in front of us so the dust wasn’t nearly as bad and you could see the trail!<br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Aaron and I started on the same row right next to each other (Novice, 2<span class="style_1">nd</span> row). When it was our turn to go, Aaron pulled out ahead of me. After the second turn I put on a burst of speed and went past him. A few moments later I came to a ditch. As I finished crossing it, to my left in my peripheral vision I saw Aaron’s bike starting to pull slightly ahead of me, except it’s orientation was all wrong. The front wheel was pointing toward the sky with the whole bike slowly rotating until it was vertical, all the while being in midair. In the meantime I saw Aaron lose his grip on the handlebars and slide backwards off the seat and onto the ground. The bike continued its arc and landed on the rear fender before throwing up a giant cloud of dust as it settled into a position of minimum energy (aka, motionless flat on the ground). <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">I grabbed a handful of brake and came to a quick stop and asked Aaron if he was ok. He said he was fine as he rapidly picked himself up off the ground to get his bike and hop back on. I said something like, “Take it easy,” and sped off to continue the race. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">It turns out that my assumption as to what happened was incorrect. In my mind I flashed back to when Aaron was about 15 years old and we lived in Alabama and were riding at our favorite spot, the Kentuck ORV trails, which had lots of little jumps on various trails. After a short break with the friends we were riding with I took the lead getting back out on the trail and hit the first jump. Much to my surprise as I was in midair I felt my handle bars being jostled from the left. I looked over and there was Aaron passing me while in flight and clipping me as he went past. I just barely managed to land without wrecking while he blasted on down the trail. It was pretty funny and we’ve laughed many times since about that incident. Anyway, I immediately assumed he was trying to pull off a repeat performance but had gotten over anxious and grabbed too much throttle coming out of the ditch. It turns out that he never even saw the ditch because of the dust. In hitting it, he was thrown toward the back of the bike and inadvertently twisted the throttle while trying to hold on. His left hand grabbed for the clutch but missed as he was sliding off the back.<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">It’s a little hard to see because of the background clutter, but here’s Aaron’s rear fender after we got home:<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style"><div style="height: 431px; width: 574px;  height: 431px; position: relative; width: 574px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_2"><img src="18_Aarons_First_Desert_Dirt_Bike_Race_files/DSCN2329.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 431px; width: 575px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">For the next 20 minutes of the race a new pattern kept repeating itself. I would hear a 2-stroke behind me (Aaron and I both ride KTM 300’s) and it would sound just like Aaron’s bike. However, a few minutes later the bike would pass me and it would be someone else. So, I discovered that the rattle-like noise that his bike makes isn’t nearly as distinctive as I had assumed. I started to hear yet another 2 stroke behind me and thought it must be someone else just as the 3 previous ones had been. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">At that point the trail dropped down into the longest wash on the course. The dust was blinding and it was very difficult to see anything. I thought to myself that the poor person behind me must be having a particularly difficult time as I gassed my bike to get from turn to turn. I could only imagine how much dust I was kicking up. After getting out of the wash I was passed yet again by the 2 stroke behind me. I felt bad though because this time it really was Aaron!<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">For hydration I had chosen not to wear my usual Camelbak backpack. Instead, I had a waist pack so as to keep weight off my back in deference to several degenerated discs in my low back. I found the waist pack to be pretty useless though because the mouthpiece was secured to the belt, rather than to a shoulder strap like for my normal backpack. The distance from waist to mouth was just too far to take my hand off the handlebar and not crash. So, I did without water. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Just after the 25 mile mark I noticed that the waist pack suddenly was much lighter. In fact, it was so light it felt like the water bladder was empty. A minute or two later I felt my body being pulled from behind at the waist down into the seat of my bike with irresistable force. I knew immediately what must have happened and came to a quick stop. Sure enough, the drinking tube had come unfastened from the belt and fallen down by the rear wheel. Due to one of the immutable laws of the universe, namely, that if anything dangles down by a wheel it will invariably get sucked into the wheel, the drinking tube was wrapped many times around the wheel hub and was stretched into a thin, tight elastic band up to the waist pack. After about 5 minutes I was able to get the drinking tube unwound from the wheel and stuff it into a pocket. Prior to being sucked into the wheel, the bite valve on the end of the tube had been pulled off by the spinning spokes and was no where to be found. Undoubtedly, this accounts for the waist pack feeling unaccountably light right before I was pulled down onto the seat. The waist pack was permanently discarded at the truck when I made it to the pits. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Here is a picture of the waist pack and tube (also note lack of bite valve on the end):<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph paragraph_style"><div style="height: 431px; width: 574px;  height: 431px; position: relative; width: 574px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_3"><img src="18_Aarons_First_Desert_Dirt_Bike_Race_files/DSCN2334.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 431px; width: 575px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Meanwhile, Aaron had made it back to the truck 6-7 minutes before I did. We took our sweet time gassing up, drinking lots of fluids, and devouring anything we could grab to eat before heading out for the 2<span class="style_1">nd</span> loop. I started off in the lead and kept it at a nice sustainable pace. When I blew a corner into some trees Aaron passed me. I was able to come up close to him a little while later and I recognized something I’ve seen many times in the last half of a race: a rider who was riding slower than normal in order to conserve energy. A few minutes later he blew a corner and I passed him. I didn’t see him again until I got to the finish. As I was chugging the well-appreciated bottle of water I was handed, I looked back and saw Aaron coming into the finish about a minute and a half after I had gotten there. So, the young guy was faster on the first lap, but the old guy had a little more staying power on the last lap. In any case, we had an absolute blast doing the race together! What a memorable experience—it just doesn’t get any better than doing a race together with your son! <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Here are a few other observations/comments in no particular order:<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">1. The dust was incredible. During the first lap I was amazed when I suddenly realized that I had mud in my mouth from all of the dust coming in contact with saliva. Not a pleasant discovery. I was in a quandary as to what to do with it because I just knew that if I tried to spit it out I would get it inside my helmet. <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">2. It seemed like I passed the same guys over and over on the first lap. Once past them I would stall or low side it in a corner and they would all get by me and I’d have to pass them all again. I can’t count how many times this happened. I’m sure they were thinking the same thing about me—“Man, why do we have to pass this same guy over and over??”<br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">3. On our ride home we started off with a few flies in the cab of our truck, which was annoying. So we’d swat them or open a window to try to get them to exit. The only trouble was, this continued for the whole 2 hours of the ride home. We must have dealt with 25 or more flies. It’s hard to believe we picked up that many in pit row. I guess that when they saw a chance to escape the ranch they took it! <br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Finally, many thanks to the Buzzards and Eliason family—great job on an excellent course!<br /></p>
