                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">Two years ago I did a few dirt bike desert races just to try them out. In the intervening time I have gotten in a lot more riding which has given me more experience as a rider, and I have had to become more fit to deal with blood clot issues. Today I tried racing again, curious to see if all of the riding and exercise has made a difference. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The race was put on by the Buzzards club at Cherry Creek, just north of LIttle Sahara sand dunes and about 45 minutes west of Nephi. The course consisted of going two times around a 45 mile loop. The trail wound through washes, meadows, up into the hills, out into the sand, and included some gnarly hill climbs and descents. Some of the trails were great single track, but there were also a lot of whoops, which came in every variety--hard packed dirt, sand, gravel, silt, rocks, and combinations thereof.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Getting ready to unload just off pit row:<br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body"><div style="height: 458px; width: 610px;  height: 458px; position: relative; width: 610px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_0"><img src="12_Great_Week_for_Dirt_Biking%21_files/DSCN1884.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 458px; width: 611px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">The start was grand prix-style, with several classes starting at one minute intervals. I was in the Novice Over 45 class so there were about 10 other classes (all of the Expert and Amateurs, and the younger Novice classes) that started before us. The Novice Over 40 class started in the same time slot as ours so there were about 15 riders in our group. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">On the line before the start:<br /></p>

                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">When the green starter light came on we took off. The trail funneled into a very narrow wash (single bike width) and the dust was horrendous. I could barely make out the rider in front of me at times, and at others I couldn’t see a thing. It was disconcerting not knowing what was coming up!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">We eventually popped out of the wash and the field of riders started to spread out, which reduced the dust problem. It was a lot of fun as I actually passed a number of riders--that hadn’t really happened before!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">It took me slightly over 2 hrs to finish the loop the first time. Although I had come to the race by myself, some friends I ran into before the race offered to pit for me. As I came into the pits they gassed up my bike while I grabbed a banana and a Clif bar, and then I was off for the 2nd loop. I slowed down quite a bit to conserve energy. I found my usual routine of eating a whole wheat fig bar every half hour or so, along with a little gatorade, helped quite a bit. After eating I would feel energetic for awhile and be able to pick up the pace. <br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Within about 5 miles of the end of the last loop I started to come up on a guy who was obviously taking it easy, sitting and riding relatively slow. I figured he was near his limit physically. However, as I got within about 20 yards of him he became aware of my presence and immediately stood up and started going faster, pulling ahead to about 100 yards in front of me. I stayed with my pace, which I thought was sustainable. I was hoping that he would get so tired he’d wreck, at which point I could pass him. Sure enough, as I came around one corner filled with deep sand, there was his bike lying in the sand with him getting up. I slowed down and asked if he was ok, to which he replied “yes” in quite a tone of disgust. Fortunately he ran out of energy before I did!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">My finish time was 5:08. To put this in perspective, the overall winner (someone at the Expert level) finished in 3:05! I don’t know how the experts go so fast. Not only must they be incredibly skilled, but also amazingly fit. Surprisingly, even though I wasn’t even close to having a fast time, it was good enough that I placed 2nd in my class and got a trophy (photo at top)--that’s never happened before either!<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">I have to say, the race was a lot of fun. And it was an amazing workout. My heart rate monitor recorded a calorie expenditure of 4,000 calories, and I had an average heart rate of 144 beats per minute over the 5 hours. Even better, my heart rate was in the 80+% of max heart rate range for almost the entire time, with a lot of time spent over 90%.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body">Because I didn’t stop much (only when I wrecked), I didn’t take any pictures out on the course. This is after finishing:<div style="height: 458px; width: 610px;  height: 458px; position: relative; width: 610px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block stroke_0 shadow_4"><img src="12_Great_Week_for_Dirt_Biking%21_files/DSCN1896.jpg" alt="" style="border: none; height: 458px; width: 611px; " /></div><br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">As a final note, maybe the best part is that the race was my 3rd ride for the week! I was able to get out to American Fork Canyon Tuesday evening for 2 hours and again Thursday for 4.5 hours. It’s hard to have a better week than that!</p>
