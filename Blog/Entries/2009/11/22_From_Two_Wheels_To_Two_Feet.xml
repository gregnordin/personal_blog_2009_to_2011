    <richText>&lt;b&gt;A month ago I had surgery to fix a separated shoulder incurred when my mountain bike slid out on gravel a few blocks from our house. I had just come off the mountain from a great ride on singletrack and was back on pavement rounding a corner when it happened--argh. In any case, it has caused me to stay off of two wheels and rely on my two feet for exercise. The photo above is from a hike this past week with Clark Taylor to the top of Y Mountain.&#xD;&#xD;December 4, 2009&#xD;Today I hiked to the top of Y Mountain again, this time with Karl Warnick. Here&#x2019;s a picture from  the top.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
