    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Finally, enough snow has melted to get the dirt bike out and ride! Matt, Steve, and I went to 5 Mile Pass for a few hours of afternoon riding. The temperature was in the low 60&#x2019;s and the sky was blue--perfect riding weather! I&#x2019;m including a few pictures below:&#xD; &#xD;Mine tailing&#xD; &#xD;After going up Rattlesnake Canyon we headed up Constrictor Canyon, the most interesting feature of which is this 6-7 foot waterfall that jeepers love to try and go up. We stopped before this point and walked the last little bit to show Matt, and to scope out a way around for a future attempt.&#xD; &#xD;Just above where we left the bikes was this old mine carved into the side of the canyon.&#xD; &#xD;Matt&#xD; &#xD;Steve&#xD; &#xD;Greg&#xD; &#xD;View from the trail--there are still patches of snow on some of the north-facing slopes.&#xD; &#xD;Matt&#xD; &#xD;Another view from the trail, looking to the south.&#xD; &#xD;And looking east toward the back of Lake Mountain, which is located on the west side of Utah Lake.&#xD;&#xD;Bottom line: it was great to get back out on the bike!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
